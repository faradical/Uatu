An web application that tracks land prices in America. A demonstration made for my data science students.

## Abstract
The objective of this project is to use a combination webscraping, flask, and javascript to demonstrate how to design and build a web application. The program will feature a way to initally populate a database with real estate data scraped from www.landwatch.com as well as a flask application that serves both an API with analytics from the database and a web page with JavaScript able to access this API and display the results on the page.
